# WRCT Reviews

A website to host albums/reviews

## Getting started with local development
1. Create a python virtual environment
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```
1. Activate the new virtual environment
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
1. Install required python modules
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. Add this line to docker-compose.yml under `reviews-backend:` right above `networks:`
    ```
        ports:
          - "8001:8001"
    ```
1. You might need to comment out the var `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` in settings.py. I don't remember, so if you find out it is or isn't necessary, please update this README ðŸ˜…
1. Build the docker container from the Dockerfile
    ```
    docker build .
    ```
1. Launch docker container. If you want it to live in the background instead of sitting in your terminal, add `-d` to the end.
    ```
    docker compose up --watch
    ```
1. Open a shell inside the docker container
    ```
    docker exec -it wrct-reviews-backend bash
    ```
1. Create an admin user account for yourself for local development
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
1. In your browser, go to [127.0.0.1:8001](http://127.0.0.1:8001/) or [0.0.0.0:8001](http://0.0.0.1:8001/) to access the app. You can also access the Django admin page by appending [/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8001/admin) to the URL.

1. Add some albums if you need test data. *TODO:* Add some test data to this repo or add an easy way to copy data from the real database to local developemnt.

1. When you're done, shut down the docker container by pressing ctrl+C in the shell that it's running in, or by running this:
    ```
    docker compose down
    ```

Next time, just run `docker compose up` to get going again.
