TODO
* list views
* CRUD views
* authentication via oauth
* auth levels
* search page

home page:
* quick links: (bin stuff)
* user information
    * how many reviews you made
    * who is logged in / their dj name
* recent reviews
    * add a review button
* recent bin additions
    * add an album/artist/label whatever

is there some way I can get recent actions? like the Django admin LogEntry, but then display messages like `<user> added <album> to the bin`, or, `<user> moved <album> from TBR to In Bin`?

TODO:
* create a better way to dynamically create the table that I have in my home page, and will use in my list views
    * template tags maybe?
